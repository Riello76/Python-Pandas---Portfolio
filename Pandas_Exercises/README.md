# Pandas DataFrames Mastery - Notebooks 01 & 02

This repository contains two Google Colab notebooks (`.ipynb` files) dedicated to mastering the **Pandas** library, the essential tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The notebooks are structured to move from DataFrame creation and inspection to advanced data selection and filtering techniques.

## ✨ Key Concepts Covered

### 🛠️ Notebook 01: Creation, Properties, and Basic Manipulation
This notebook focuses on setting up and understanding the structure of a Pandas DataFrame:

* **DataFrame Creation:** How to make pandas DataFrames from other Python collections (e.g., lists of lists, dictionaries).
* **Inspection:** Learning about your DataFrame's properties and information (e.g., `.shape`, `.dtypes`, `.info()`).
* **Column Operations:** Selecting a single column.
* **Modification:** Adding new columns to a DataFrame.
* **Renaming:** Renaming columns (using `.rename()` or assignment).
* **Summary Statistics:** Calculating descriptive stats on the columns (e.g., `.describe()`).

### 🔍 Notebook 02: Selection, Filtering, and Sorting
The second notebook applies these fundamentals to real-world data manipulation tasks:

* **Jupyter/Colab Features:** Helpful Jupyter features (e.g., magics, shortcuts).
* **Data Import:** Importing a CSV dataset into a DataFrame.
* **Advanced Selection:** Selecting multiple columns (passing a list of column names).
* **Boolean Logic:** Counting `True` values in a Boolean series.
* **Filtering:** Filtering rows with **Boolean masks**.
* **Complex Conditions:** Using **AND** (`&`) and **OR** (`|`) operators to create complex filtering criteria.
* **Copying Data:** Understanding why and when to use `.copy()`.
* **Sorting:** Sorting a DataFrame by one or more columns (using `.sort_values()`).

## 🚀 How to Run the Notebooks (Google Colab)

These files are designed to run in the Google Colaboratory environment:

1.  **Access:** Ensure you are logged into your Google account.
2.  **Upload:** Upload the `.ipynb` files to your Google Drive.
3.  **Execute:** Run the code cells sequentially by clicking the **"Run"** button (▶) or pressing `Shift + Enter`.
