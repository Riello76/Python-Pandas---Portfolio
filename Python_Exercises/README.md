# Python Exercises - Day 1 & Day 2 (Master Notebooks)

This repository contains two core Google Colab notebooks (`.ipynb` files) structured to provide hands-on practice in fundamental and intermediate Python programming, focusing heavily on core language mechanics, arithmetic, and control flow.

The exercises are structured over two distinct "Days," with **Day 1** covering arithmetic and basic I/O, and **Day 2** focusing on conditional logic and loops.

## 📁 Repository Structure

| File Name | Primary Focus | Key Topic Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Python_Day_1_Exercises_Master.ipynb` | Arithmetic operations, formatting, and mathematical formulas. | **Core Python & Math** |
| `Python_Day_2_Exercises_Master.ipynb` | Conditional statements, loops, and flow control. | **Logic & Control Flow** |

## ✨ Key Concepts Covered

### 🐍 Day 1: Arithmetic, Formatting, and Input/Output
This notebook focuses on direct numerical manipulation and clear presentation of results:

* **Digit Extraction:** Specifically extract digits from numbers using **floor division** and **modulus** to sum or reverse digits.
* **Formula Application:** Measure and calculate **areas and distances** applying appropriate mathematical formulas.
* **Unit Conversion:** Accept user input and convert **temperature units** accurately (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
* **Output Formatting:** Report results clearly using formatted output statements (e.g., f-strings or `.format()`).
* **Debugging:** Troubleshoot simple arithmetic operations in Python independently.

### ⚙️ Day 2: Control Flow and Logic
The second notebook builds logic and control into the programs:

* **Conditional Statements:** Use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to control the flow of a program.
* **Modulus Operator:** Apply the modulus operator (`%`) to check number properties like **divisibility and parity** (odd/even).
* **Authentication Logic:** Implement input validation and string comparisons to build basic user authentication logic.
* **While Loops:** Use a `while` loop to repeat tasks based on conditions such as success criteria or attempt limits.
* **Interactive Programs:** Combine loops and decision-making logic to build interactive programs like **simple menus**.
* **For Loops:** Practice using a `for` loop with the `range()` function to iterate over numbers efficiently.

## 🚀 How to Run the Notebooks

These files are designed to run in the Google Colaboratory environment:

1.  **Access:** Ensure you are logged into your Google account.
2.  **Upload:** Upload the `.ipynb` files to your Google Drive.
3.  **Execute:** Run the code cells sequentially by clicking the **"Run"** button (▶) or pressing `Shift + Enter`.
