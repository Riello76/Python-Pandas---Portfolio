# 🐍 Python Exercises - Day 1 & Day 2 (Master Notebooks)

This repository contains two core Google Colab notebooks (`.ipynb` files) structured to provide hands-on practice in fundamental and intermediate Python programming, focusing on core language mechanics, arithmetic, and control flow.

The exercises are structured over two distinct "Days," with **Day 1** covering arithmetic and basic I/O, and **Day 2** focusing on conditional logic and loops.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

| File Name | Primary Focus | Key Topic Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Python_Day_1_Exercises_Master.ipynb` | Arithmetic operations, formatting, and mathematical formulas. | **Core Python & Math** |
| `Python_Day_2_Exercises_Master.ipynb` | Conditional statements, loops, and flow control. | **Logic & Control Flow** |

## ✨ Key Concepts Covered

### 🛠 Day 1: Arithmetic, Formatting, and Input/Output
- **Digit Extraction:** Extract digits from numbers using floor division and modulus.  
- **Formula Application:** Calculate areas, distances, and other values with mathematical formulas.  
- **Unit Conversion:** Convert temperature units or other measures based on user input.  
- **Output Formatting:** Use f-strings or `.format()` to display results clearly.  
- **Debugging:** Troubleshoot simple arithmetic operations and logic independently.  

### ⚙️ Day 2: Control Flow and Logic
- **Conditional Statements:** Apply `if`, `elif`, `else` for decision-making.  
- **Modulus Operator:** Check divisibility and parity (odd/even numbers).  
- **Authentication Logic:** Implement basic input validation and string checks.  
- **While Loops:** Repeat tasks based on conditions or attempt limits.  
- **Interactive Programs:** Build small menus or interactive tasks combining loops and logic.  
- **For Loops:** Iterate efficiently over ranges using `range()`.
