## 2. Detailed Notebook Content

### 🐍 Python Fundamentals & Logic

#### **`Python_Day_1_Exercises_Master.ipynb` (Arithmetic and Formatting)**
This notebook focuses on direct numerical manipulation and clear output presentation:
* **Digit Manipulation:** Extracting digits using **floor division** (`//`) and **modulus** (`%`) to sum or reverse digits.
* **Formulas:** Measuring and calculating **areas and distances** applying appropriate mathematical formulas.
* **I/O and Conversion:** Accepting user input and converting **temperature units** accurately (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
* **Formatting:** Reporting results clearly using formatted output statements.

#### **`Python_Day_2_Exercises_Master.ipynb` (Control Flow and Decision Logic)**
This notebook builds logic and flow control into the programs:
* **Conditionals:** Using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to control program flow.
* **Modulus Operator:** Applying the modulus operator (`%`) to check number properties like **divisibility and parity**.
* **Loops:** Implementing `while` loops (for condition-based repetition) and `for` loops with the `range()` function.
* **Interactive Programs:** Combining loops and decision-making logic to build interactive programs like simple menus.

### 📊 Pandas DataFrames

#### **`PandasDataFrames_01.ipynb` (Creation and Properties)**
This notebook covers the fundamental structure and creation of DataFrames:
* **Creation:** How to make DataFrames from other Python collections (e.g., lists, dictionaries).
* **Inspection:** Learning about DataFrame properties (`.shape`, `.info()`) and accessing descriptive stats (`.describe()`).
* **Column Manipulation:** Selecting a single column, adding new columns, and renaming columns.

#### **`PandasDataFrames_02.ipynb` (Selection, Filtering, and Sorting)**
This notebook introduces essential techniques for querying and manipulating data effectively:
* **Data Loading:** Importing a CSV dataset.
* **Advanced Selection:** Selecting multiple columns and counting `True` values in a Boolean series.
* **Filtering:** Filtering rows using **Boolean masks**.
* **Complex Logic:** Using **AND** (`&`) and **OR** (`|`) operators for complex filtering criteria.
* **Best Practices:** Understanding why and when to use `.copy()`.
* **Sorting:** Sorting a DataFrame by one or more columns (`.sort_values()`).

## 📚 Supplementary Workbook

#### **`Python_Workbook_Week_6.docx`**
This supplementary document provides additional theoretical context, practice questions, and challenges related to the concepts covered in the Python and Pandas notebooks for a specific learning module (Week 6).
